# kashikoi

kashikoi (pronounced kash-coy) is your music theory friend. kashikoi is a Japanese word that 
means wise, intelligent, bright, or clever.

I'm writing this Python library because I've been reusing some music theory facilities
and copying the files in every music side project I try in Python. I want kashikoi to
encapsulate all things music theory so I can reuse it in other libraries and avoid
copy-pasta.

kashikoi will be able to answer music theory questions and perhaps also recommend
notes, chords, scales, and other things for helping with writer's block for composition.
